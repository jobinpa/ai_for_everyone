# AI for Everyone

This my personal repository for the most excellent [AI for Everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gD_HWj_hvbo&list=PLGs0VKk2DiYyXlbJVaE8y1qr24YldYNDm) lessons published by Paul McWhorter.

__IMPORTANT:__
The device ID of my camera is 1. If you get a runtime error, try to set the
camera ID to 0. Most of the files have a CAM_ID parameter on the top however,
for those without this parameter, look for `cv2.VideoCapture` and update the
first argument.
